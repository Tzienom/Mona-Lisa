        <p class="paragraph animated-text">
          My thoughts often linger upon the very first moment I was attended by
          your portrait—though it remained unmoving, it was poised with the
          essence of life itself. The gaze with which you regarded me possessed
          the power to ensnare, an affliction that could only be tempered by an
          enchantress. In the wake of that moment, a light burden weighed upon
          the cart of my heart, spirited away long before my mind could fathom
          the path in which it wandered—you had become to me what Mona Lisa is
          to the rest of the world—an artistic excellence, wrought from the hand
          of a Master intent on sculpting his finest work, but you, my dear,
          remain unmarred by the hands of man.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph animated-text">
          The affections I bear for you are not born of fleeting sentiments, but
          genuine care and respect. Our first encounter was not of a fiery
          exchange, but like a gentle breeze that breathed life into the
          withered bower of my heart. The weeks following our initial
          correspondence brought a tempest of longing that threatened ruin to
          the seat of my reason—thoughts of you became the favoured object to
          which my mind would go adrift. My heart, once steady and serene in its
          rhythm, now dances to the harmony in the tenor of your speech, yet my
          mind sought not to be in consonance with this rhythm, but to strike
          instead a dissonant chord—but such passions as burn within me are too
          greatly aflame to be subdued—a testament to the truth that I am unable
          to love you gently, for it is not in me to love by halves—I shall love
          you completely and madly.
        </p>

          You, my dear girl, are an epitome of resplendent wonder, and I find
          myself quite undone in your society. To behold your likeness is to be
          short of breath as one who has gazed upon the face of the angel,
          Gabriel himself. When the day shall come that we would saunter in a
          field awash with blossoms of every hue, I shall pluck you a
          primrose—not for its beauty, though it is fair, neither for its
          rarity, although it is cherished—but it is the first bloom of spring
          and its beauty remains the longest.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph animated-text">
          I must beg your gracious leave, my dear Chinyere, to address your
          parents for a formal acknowledgement of my intent to ask the hand of
          their precious daughter, that I may love and cherish her as no other
          could, until my last breath.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph animated-text">
          I intended to write you words of poetry, but the thoughts of you took
          control of my hand, and I ceased to be in command of my pen, thus
          laying myself bare to the tide of my emotions.
